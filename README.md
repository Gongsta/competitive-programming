# Competitive Programming
Welcome to my competitive programming project page. On here, I upload my solutions to all the problems I have solved (Mainly DMOJ + Codeforces), as well as write down my reflections.

Goals: Not necessarily becoming the best in the world, but good enough to be proud of myself, maybe getting very close / winning a contest.
- Codeforces
- Google Code Jam
- ICPC

Credits to [Andy Zhu's page](https://github.com/andyzhu23/Competitive-Programming/) and [Colin Galen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-aylp6MZnM&ab_channel=ColinGalen) for the inspiration to do this. I usually prefer reflecting using my own [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md/), but I realized it would take way too many pages (I would have made one for each contest / problem I've solved). Thus, I decided to host them on here directly.

[SAC '22 Code Challenge 5 Junior](https://dmoj.ca/contest/sac22cc5j)|May 23, 2022 |300 / 500|[49 / 67](https://dmoj.ca/contest/sac22cc5j/ranking/#!Gongsta) | My first coding contest. I did absolutely terrible and felt terribly seeing my friends do well. I'm to take competitive programming seriously and get better at this. Plus, Competitive Programming seems actually so fun, the competing aspect and rating system is amazing. I haven't competed in something in a pretty long time, and this just brings back the competitive fuel in me to do. I'm big on self-improvement, and I love it when I see myself progress, so this is the perfect opportunity.
[Codeforces Round #795 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1691) | May 31, 2022 | [288 / ](https://codeforces.com/submissions/stevengongg/contest/1691) | This was my first codeforces contest, so it was just about getting familiar with the platform. 
[Codeforces Round #796(Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1688) | Jun 3, 2022 | [288 / ](https://codeforces.com/submissions/stevengongg/contest/1688) | I am both proud and disappointed with this one. I managed to solve three out of the 6 problems for the pretests. In fact, I managed to solve problem D, which I didn't think I was capable of!! Was worth 1600 points in terms of difficulty, and I did it! However, I failed 2 of them after the system testing because of TLE... I checked my code and could have made super easy optimizations so that it passed. The first problem, I used a for loop instead of just directly computing the smallest numberAlso, For some reason, my rating did not change at all? f
