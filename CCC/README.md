# CCC Problems
The skills needed is taken directly from the DMOJ site. The difficulty is based on my personal feelings. 

Problem | Skills Needed | Difficulty | Status | Date | Solution
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---: | :---: | :---: 
[CCC'22 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc22s3) | Ad Hoc, Greedy Algorithms | 2.5/5 | Incomplete | 06-05-2022 | |
[CCC'21 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc21s3) |  | | |
[CCC'20 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc20s3) |  | | |
[CCC'19 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc19s3) |People are saying this problem is VERY difficult.  | | |
[CCC'18 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc18s3) |  | | |
[CCC'17 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc17s3) | Didn't know, I read the editorial. Apparently it was simple math. Okay, I considered brute forcing but thought it was too slow. Actually, I did not even consider the proper brute forcing technique because I was too intimidated by the idea of trying all the different permutations. Lesson: definitely consider brute forcing and think about optimizing that brute force. | (3/5 for me) even though only 7 pts | |
[CCC'16 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc16s3) | Got a working solution, but it used up too much memory after trying to implement the editorial. Learned about trees and finding the diameter using two DFS. | 3/5 (15 pts), but 4/5 for the memory requirements.. | Not Completed (Memory Limit, other implementation doesn't work...) |
[CCC'15 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc15s3) | Implemented using an ordered set. Use a greedy algorithm to always put the plane at last gate it can, storing the available gates in the set. | 2/5 (10 pts) | Done| 05-31-2022 | [ccc15s3.cpp](ccc15s3.cpp)
[CCC'14 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc14s3) | Reminds me of the Tower of Hanoi problem, and there's this other problem as well! Can't remember because I didn't solve it, will add it back once I figure it out. Solved by using stacks and basically implementing it. | 1.5/5 | Done | 06-05-2022 | [ccc14s3.cpp](ccc14s3.cpp)
[CCC'13 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc13s3) |  | ||
[CCC'12 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc12s3) | Just read the question carefully, implementation problem | ||
[CCC'11 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc11s3) | Just use recursion | 1/5 | Done| 06-03-2022|[ccc11s3.cpp](ccc11s3.cpp)
[CCC'10 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc10s3) | Seems pretty similar to ccc21s3, where you want to minimize a certain distance from X amount of things |3.5 ||
[CCC'09 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc09s3) | Graph Theory | 1/5| Done | 06-05-2022 |[ccc09s3.cpp](ccc09s3.cpp) |
[CCC'08 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc08s3) |  | ||
[CCC'07 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc07s3) |  | ||
[CCC'06 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc06s3) | A Geometry problem! Was running into this super annoying bug? I kept getting 1/4 WA, and I couldnt' figure out the edge case where this happened...And it's because my logic checking for intersection was wrong! Understand that there are 3 intersection cases, and sometimes (like in this problem), it boils down to one.| 2/5 (12 pts)| Done | 06-06-2022 | [ccc06s3.cpp](ccc06s3.cpp)
[CCC'05 S3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc05s3) |  | ||

[CCC'20 S4](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc20s4) |  | | |
[CCC'19 S4](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc19s4) |  | |
[CCC'18 S4](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc18s4) | I came up with a DP brute force way of doing it, which I am pretty proud of, but it was still too slow. You notice that you only need to compute certain intervals, I notice pattern similar to the [Min number of 0's in range [a,b] problem!]() (although I don't think I solved that one either) | ||

[CCC'16 S4](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc16s4) |  | ||
[CCC'15 S4](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc15s4) | Convex Hull problem, it's a variation of Dijkstras. For some reason, I fail this one test case ;-; Wasted like an entire hour on this problem.... | ||
