Welcome to my competitive programming project page. On here, I upload my solutions to all the problems I have solved (Mainly DMOJ + Codeforces), as well as write down my reflections.

**Goal**: Get to red (2400) on Codeforces and DMOJ. Not necessarily becoming the best in the world, but good enough to be proud of myself, maybe getting very close / winning a contest. Started on May 23rd, 2022.

Credits to [Andy Zhu's page](https://github.com/andyzhu23/Competitive-Programming/) and [Colin Galen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-aylp6MZnM&ab_channel=ColinGalen) for inspiring me to do this. I usually prefer reflecting using my own [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md/), but I realized it would take way too many pages (I would have made one for each contest / problem I've solved). Thus, I decided to host them on here directly. 

Cool people with interesting problems on their profiles.

CCC Junior 2018 | February 2018 | 0 / 5 solved :( | -1 (last) | <details><summary>My 1st EVER CP Contest</summary>The beginning (and at that time end) of my competitive programming journey? This was an embarrassing moment for me, because I actually got 0 out of 75. It wasn't even because the problems were hard (this was the junior version of the contest), but I did 0 preperation the night before the contest so I had wrong assumptions about how the input and output of the problems were handled in Python. I struggled for the entire contest trying to understand why my solution wasn't working for the simplest problem, when I was just reading the input wrong...never touched Competitive Programming (CP) again for the next 4 years.
[Leetcode Weekly Contest 295](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-295) | May 28, 2022 | 1 / 4 solved| 13392 | <details><summary>1st Leetcode Contest</summary>Did my first Leetcode contest, only managing to solve 1 problem. Not very happy with this performance considering I've been practicing over the past week, but I know to trust to the process. Did this as well to prepare for the upcoming YAC3 contest, where I'll finally get a DMOJ rating.
[Yet Another Contest 3](https://dmoj.ca/contest/yac3)|May 30, 2022| (0.5+0.5) / 5 solved |[91 (95 total)](https://dmoj.ca/contest/yac3/ranking/#!Gongsta)| <details><summary>2nd DMOJ Contest (1st rated)</summary>My second DMOJ contest. Was super excited for this one because it was the first RATED contest I was going to write, and thus finally get a rating. Was hoping to get at least 200-300/500 points during the contest. Couldn't come up with the full solutions, so I opted to try and go for part marks, so at least I wouldn't get a 0. Ended getting part marks for 2 questions. Got assigned a blue-colored rating of 1349, which I am pretty happy with (people usually start in grey / green). However, I know I need to push hard as this rating might just be an outlier, not reflective of my real hidden rating.
[Codeforces Round #795 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1691) | May 31, 2022 | [ 1 / 6 solved](https://codeforces.com/contest/1691/my) <br> |[13631](https://codeforces.com/contest/1691/standings/participant/133908721#p133908721) |<details><summary>1st Codeforces Contest</summary> Codeforces is the most popular CP contest site in the world. I decided to do my first codeforces contest, so it was just about getting familiar with the platform. On Codeforces, your code doesn't immediately pass everything during the contest, it just tries to pass the pretest. There is only a rigorous system testing that happens after the contest ends, so while you might pass the pretest, you might actually fail a problem after system tasking (and thus get 0). The codeforces problems feel much harder than the DMOJ, and this was Div. 2. I got assigned a rating of 366... which is meager compared to my rating of 1349 on DMOJ. DMOJ is inflated.
[Codeforces Round #796 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1688) | Jun 3, 2022 | [1 / 5 solved](https://codeforces.com/submissions/stevengongg/contest/1688) | [8842 ](https://codeforces.com/contest/1688/standings/participant/134147624#p134147624) |<details><summary>2nd Codeforces Contest</summary> I am both proud and disappointed with this one. I managed to solve 3 out of the 6 problems during the competition. In fact, I skipped problem C and solved problem D, which I didn't think I was capable of!! Was worth 1600 points in terms of difficulty, and I did it! However, I actually failed 2/3 of them after the final system testing because of TLE... I checked my code and could have made super easy optimizations so that it passed. The first problem, I used a for loop instead of just directly computing the smallest number. For problem D, I implemented a cumulative sum solution in $O(n^2)$ when I knew I could easily have done a 2-pointers implementation in $O(n)$, but I didn't do it for some reason...Gained a rating of around 300 which makes my rating around 600 now. Still a lot of room for improvement. 
[Leetcode Weekly Contest 296](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-296) | June 4, 2022 | 4 / 4 solved (FIRST Full Score!) | [2608 (24229 total)](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-296/ranking) | <details><summary>2nd Leetcode Contest</summary> I am pretty happy with this one, as it is the first time I actually got a full score on a contest! I feel like the effort of focusing my training on more difficult coding sites (DMOJ + codeforces) is paying off, because the problems on Leetcode suddenly feel so much easier. I did, however, use Python instead of C++ on the last HARD problem. It just felt impossible to implement in C++. So maybe this time, I got lucky with my first full score.
[Codeforces Round #797 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1690) | Jun 7, 2022 | [ 3 / 7 solved](https://codeforces.com/submissions/stevengongg/contest/1690)| [ 9584 ](https://codeforces.com/contest/1690/standings/participant/134230188#p134230188) |<details><summary>3rd Codeforces Contest</summary> I'm prretty frustrated because I should have gotten D, it was a string processing question> I was very happy with myself because I came up with the solution pretty quickly. However, when I submitted my solution, it said time limit exceeded?? Attempted 2 more times without success. If I had gotten that question, I would have moved up ranks by 4000 people... this is so frustrating. There was also the second question in which I had a wrong submission, because I failed to consider a certain edge case, so I needed to add an if statement at the very end. 
[Cheerio Contest 1 Division](https://dmoj.ca/contest/cheerio1j) | Jun 9, 2022 | 4 / 5 solved| [ 13 / 34 ](https://dmoj.ca/contest/cheerio1j/ranking/) |<details><summary>3rd DMOJ Contest (unrated)</summary>So I was not planning on doing this contest since it was unrated, however I wanted to give it a shot. I opted to do the junior edition, hoping to get full marks. Was pretty happy with my performance, as I solved the first 4 questions pretty quickly, although for some reason I could not solve the last problem...I am really going to try and make sure I don't mess up any easy questions. The senior edition was much harder, I could only solve the first one ;( Also, sidenote I have decided that I am going to spend a lot more time practicing on the DMOPC contest questions (main contests on DMOJ). I have a folder for the CCC, but I think I also want one for the DMOPC since they host monthly contests there, and I really want to do well on them. They only run once a month, so I cannot choke. DMOJ has a lot fewer contests that codeforces (which happen 1-2x a week), so I don't have a lot of opportunities to make my rating go up fast. 
[Codeforces Round #798 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1689) | Jun 10, 2022 | [ 1 / 5 solved](https://codeforces.com/submissions/stevengongg/contest/1689)| [ 7745 ](https://codeforces.com/contest/1689/standings/participant/134444431#p134444431) |<details><summary>4th Codeforces Contest</summary>I only managed to solve one question, which is quite disappointing :(
[Leetcode Biweekly Contest 80](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-296) | June 11, 2022 | 2 / 4 solved | [6801](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-80/ranking) | <details><summary>3rd Leetcode Contest</summary>Got 2 out of 4 solved, which definitely means last time was an outlier. I am doing 2 contests today, both the weekly and biweekly.
[Leetcode BiWeekly Contest 297](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-297) | June 11, 2022 | 1 / 4 solved | [7856](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-297/ranking) | <details><summary>4th Leetcode Contest</summary>This week's contest seemed a lot harder, I only managed to solve 1 of them. I came up with a solution for the second question, but it was just too slow. 
[Educational Codeforces Round #130 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1697) | Jun 12, 2022 | [ 2 / 6 solved](https://codeforces.com/submissions/stevengongg/contest/1697)| [ ? ]() |<details><summary>5th Codeforces Contest</summary>I was pretty happy because I got the first question pretty quickly (< 5 mins), and I was also going to solve the 2nd question very fast, but then I got WA and spent 1 hour trying to debug it, when it really was just an integer overflow... I had to use `long long`. If I got it earlier, I might have been able to solve a 3rd or 4th question... I am going to spend the next few days really trying to solve all of the questions on the contests. The editorials are pretty high quality, so I am going to focus on Codeforces rather than DMOJ.
