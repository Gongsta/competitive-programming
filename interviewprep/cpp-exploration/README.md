Code is the ultimate source of truth. These are some explorations to convince myself of the true behavior
of things, understand how they all work.

Concepts:

- `string_view`
- `typeid`
- `decltype`

Template meta-programming is one of the pillars of modern C++. But it gets pretty hard to debug templates, with
all those error messages going around.

TODO:

- What is RAII?
- unique_ptr (i actually got it wrong the first time, got confused about copy constructor being enabled, whereas you should be looking at move semantics)
