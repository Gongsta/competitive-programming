    Ideas: 
    1. (probs BAD) We can use Djikstra's Algorithm, but we would need to start at every Pho restaurant and find the max distance between 2 given pho restaurants.
        - And that doesn't work because that's not the question, you need to visit ALL Pho restaurants so its 
        a shortest path question but with EVERY node visit. Maybe Chapter 19?
        - Find the shortest hamiltonian path

    Maybe build a minimum spanning tree, and then Djikstras? NO
    
    2. Some tree algorithm for the CP Handbook... NO
